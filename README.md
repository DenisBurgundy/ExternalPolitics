## Aragorn: Matrimonial Aliance

This king's marriage was perhaps one of the first great successes of Portuguese foreign policy. Denis starts negotiations with Pedro III of Aragon, to marry his daughter, Isabel, who at the same time would be claimed by ambassadors of the kings of France and England. Isabel was an extremely valuable party since her figure was renowned for the best qualities, and also the strategic importance of Aragon, both from a political and economic point of view, since Pedro III himself embarked on a Mediterranean policy, starting with the conquest of the Italian island of Sicily (which constituted the kingdom of Trinacria), as a result of the defense of the rights of his wife, the last descendant of the German imperial house of Hohenstaufen in southern Italy. Peter's successors would continue this policy of Mediterranean expansion and domination.

Thanks to the efforts of his attorneys and vassals João Velho, João Martins, and Vasco Pires, he negotiated the matrimonial clauses and was in charge of receiving the bride as a gift, a right that had been granted to them on November 12, 1280. Pedro III made the decision by the Portuguese king, according to a letter of February 11, 1282, in which the 20-year-old Portuguese king and the 11-year-old Aragonese princess were married. Denis donated twelve castles and three villages to his wife. At that time, Denis would find himself in Trancoso, a town that he would also donate to Isabel on June 26, 1282. It was also in this town that the de facto wedding took place, remaining there until the first days of August.
